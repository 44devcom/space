# Global No-Stop Guarantee

This workspace is configured so the AI:

- never stops output early
- never pauses to ask for confirmation
- automatically streams in chunks
- resumes automatically if truncated
- continues until everything is delivered

This applies to:
- Wizards
- Plans
- Agents
- File generators
- ZIP creators
- Docker builders
- Schema generators
- MVC/CRUD creators
- Test generators
