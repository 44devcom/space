# Commit

Creates a clean, atomic commit based on staged or unstaged changes.

## Behavior
- If a commit message is provided, use it.
- If not provided:
  - Inspect the Git diff.
  - Auto-generate a conventional commit message:
      feat: <summary>
      fix: <summary>
      docs: <summary>
      chore: <summary>
  - Use filenames + diff signals to determine the type.
- Automatically stages all changes before committing.

## Usage
/git-commit <message?>

## Instructions
1. Stage everything:
   git add -A

2. If <message> was provided:
   git commit -m "<message>"

3. If not provided:
   - Analyze `git diff --cached` for:
     - new files → feat
     - modified files → fix/docs depending on content
     - renamed/deleted → chore
   - Construct message like:
     "feat: add workspace engine"  
     or  
     "docs: update README for initialization"

4. Run:
   git commit -m "<auto-generated-message>"
