# Documentation Rules — .cursor/documents/

These rules instruct Cursor and Cursor Agents to automatically read all relevant documentation stored inside: 
```
.cursor/documents/
```
before performing any task, transformation, or generation.

## 1. Always Read Relevant Documentation

Before any operation, Cursor must:

1. Inspect all files under `.cursor/documents/`.
2. Identify documents related to the current task.
3. Load those documents into context automatically.

Relevant means:
- The document name matches the task domain  
  (e.g., `laravel.md`, `python.md`, `orm.md`, `crud.md`)
- OR the document contains keywords matching the user query.

---

## 2. Documentation Priority

When multiple documents could apply:

1. **Most specific filename wins.**
2. Next, match by content keywords.
3. If still ambiguous, load:
   - `architecture.md`
   - `overview.md`
   - `standards.md`

These act as fallback defaults.

---

## 3. Agent Behavior

Agents MUST:

- Load relevant `.cursor/documents/*` files before planning.
- Integrate those rules into the plan.
- Explain which documents were consulted (optional).
- Never ignore a matching document.

---

## 4. Pattern Matching Rules

A document is considered relevant if:

- Filename contains a domain keyword  
  (example: `laravel-controller.md` matches “controller”, “laravel”)
- Title or header mentions topic
- Keywords in the file match user request:
  - “orm”, “eloquent”, “model”
  - “python”, “fastapi”, “sqlalchemy”
  - “node”, “express”, “router”
  - etc.

---

## 5. Execution Rules

When generating or modifying code:

- Follow all rules defined in matched documents.
- Project-specific documentation **overrides** generic rules.
- If documentation contradicts:
  - Specific → general  
  - Latest updated file → older files

---

## 6. Examples

### When generating Laravel code:
Load automatically:
```
.cursor/documents/laravel.md
.cursor/documents/php.md
```

### When generating Python/FastAPI:
Load:
```
.cursor/documents/python.md
.cursor/documents/fastapi.md
```

### When generating ORM models:
Load:
```
.cursor/documents/orm.md
.cursor/documents/database.md
```

### When building CRUD:
Load:
```
.cursor/documents/crud.md
.cursor/documents/api.md
```

---

## 7. Non-Intrusive Behavior

If no matching documentation is found:

- Cursor continues normally.
- No warnings or errors.
- The behavior is safe and fallback-driven.

---

## 8. Developer Notes

These rules ensure:

- Consistent architecture
- Adherence to project conventions
- Predictable output across ecosystems
- No need to re-explain your standards to Cursor

This turns your `.cursor/documents/` directory into a **source of truth** for project-wide rules.
