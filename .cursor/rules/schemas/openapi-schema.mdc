# OpenAPI

Rules for generating OpenAPI schemas from project models and relations.

## Purpose

Define how Cursor should construct OpenAPI 3.1-compliant schemas using the JSON model definitions in schemas/models/ and relation definitions in schemas/relations/.

## Rules

- Base all OpenAPI components on the JSON Schemas under schemas/models/.
- Convert JSON Schema types to OpenAPI formats where applicable.
- Generate request/response schemas using Pydantic/Laravel DTO conventions.
- Relations should be represented as nested objects or $ref links.
- Required fields in models must map to OpenAPI required arrays.
- Enums should produce OpenAPI enum definitions.
- Arrays must include an items schema.
- Use component references: #/components/schemas/ModelName.
- Avoid generating circular references.
